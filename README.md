# MayorSec PingSweep Tool

**This is a basic ping sweep tool I wrote early in my pentesting career to look for machines that will respond to echo requests on the target network.  Keep in mind it relies on targets that are able to receive and respond to ping requests, and may not return a reply if echo is turned off on the target (common basic defense on many Windows hosts).

The tool is released as is and isn't updated in repo as it's complete to my intended functionality.
